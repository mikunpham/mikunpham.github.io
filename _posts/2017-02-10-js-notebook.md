Well, this is a notebook about Javascript that I've found out and collected on the Internet. There are so many things to learn, so that I will start from the little things first. 
This is kind of a learning diary about Javascript. I am going to keep updating things everyday or everyweek.

## Closure

A **Closure** is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.

## Functional Programming

**Functional programming** produces programs by composing mathematical functions and avoids shared state & mutable data. **Functional programming** is an essential concept in JavaScript.

Important things about it:

+ Pure functions
+ Immutability state/data
+ Avoid side-effects
+ Avoid shared state
+ Function composition
+ Mention of features that support FP: first-class functions, higher order functions, functions as arguments/values.
+ Declarative rather than imperative code (what to do, rather than how to do it)
