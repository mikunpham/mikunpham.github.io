**Memoization** is a optimization technique which attempts to increase a functionâ€™s performance by caching its previously computed results. It is especially useful in recursive functions. Let take a [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) for example (A Fibonacci number is the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers. The first two are 0 and 1).

Here is the traditional Fibonacci function:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mikunpham/6f4c2ec6bc79f54dc9209db2d8a13d2a.js"></script>

We are using recursive method to calculate the sequence. This works, but the `fibonacci` function is called 177 times. That's maybe a small number, but what if we have to compute `fibonacci(50)` ?! That would take an insane number of times to calculate and give output result. You can try!


### Memoization comes to rescue

We can use Memoization by storing returned values of a function in previous calls, and use them in further calls to the function instead of calling the function itself over and over again and re-calculate values from the beginning. That sounds great!

Here is the re-written code in memoization way:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mikunpham/8f46c96ba8e56dbe8ad4ec945c2cfe71.js"></script>

Now, the function is called 19 times - a huge optimization. You can test with `fibonacci(50)`
, it's much faster than the previous version.

## How did we do it? 

We create `memo` as an empty object to store memoized results. Everytimes the `fib` function is called, it will look for the values in `memo` to find if `memo` already has that value or not. 

+ If Yes -> Return `memo[n]`.
+ If No -> Calculate the value and store it in `memo`.

Finally, we return the result.

## Uh... It's great but it create longer codes...

We can rewrite by using [Conditional (ternary) Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) to have a cleaner version:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mikunpham/d733633be3e9e87fc511dcf3fcf0ef0d.js"></script>

_The same result -> Good!_

## Generalize memoization function

We can also genalize a memoization function, so that it can be used with other functions, not just `fibonacci` only.
